A fork of the SvgNet & SvgGdi bridge (http://www.codeproject.com/KB/cs/svgnet.aspx) to ressurrect it.

__SvgNet is now available as a Nuget:__ [SvgNet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/SvgNet/).

Work in progress: __version 2.0.0 is .NET Standard 2.0 compatible and works with .NET Core 2.0__

To build this version properly you need .NET Core 2.0.3 SDK installed as it is pinned (via global.json) 
to that version that has the right graphics dlls available, not present in later versions...
